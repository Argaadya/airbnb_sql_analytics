    "In the world with increasing data availability, it is become a norm to store and collect data from a cloud database instead of using a local file when you are part of a start up or large corporation. Several service, such as Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure provide us with a cloud storage service to store a large dataset. Most of the current database system use SQL to store and collect this data. Therefore, understanding how to write a command or a query using SQL is currently one of the top skills required in data-related job, espescially for a data analyst and data scientist. The following graph is the result of [2020 Data Science and Machine Learning Survey](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-science-tools/).\n",
